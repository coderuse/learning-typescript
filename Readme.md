# Typescript -- Learning

This is my learning project for Typescript. If someone gets benefit from it, that would be my pleasure.

Thanks.

It would be beneficial, if [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor is used to run this project.

First install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and open comand prompt and run: 

``` bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Clone the project.

States of the project has been preserved by making tags starting from `1`.

``` bash
git checkout tags/<TAG_NUMBER>
```
